* To my knowledge everything should compile correctly. 
* I have included a makefile to build my program (only tested on linux)
* didn't catch an error in w2 because of the way my program parses directives
* I tested the pong against the book's assembler and my assembler and they came
  out identical
* everything is written in c

* basic program usage:
$ ./assembler input_file.txt 

* specifiy output file
$ ./assembler input_file.txt -o output_file.txt

* print table
$ ./assembler input_file.txt -p
